        <strong>Name</strong> Michael Scott<br>

        <br><strong>Tech</strong> Average tech user.  He owns a Mac on macOS Sanoma and an iPhone 15 on iOS17.   <br>

        <br><strong>Proficiency</strong>  He knows how to navigate to and within apps. He knows how to change his settings. He is a regular social media user, so he knows how to post and share updates. <br>


        <br><strong>Frustrations / Needs</strong> Michael gets frustrated when apps and websites have too much going on (too many random colors, too many words) because it makes him feel overwhelmed.  He also hates when he misses his favorite food trucks. His friends know how much he likes them, so they always call when they see it, but sometimes he doesn't get there fast enough.  <br>

        <br><strong>Attitudes and Needs</strong> Michael has his favorite restaurants and food trucks he likes to go with his family, but he also likes trying new food palces. He enjoys posting pictures of his family and what they do during the weekends.  <br>


        <br><strong>User Story</strong> As a guest  user, I need to easily find and navigate through a website where I can follow along with the owners and other regular users when the food truck location updates.<br>


        <br><strong> Interaction Flow </strong>

       <p> It's a saturday afternoon and Michael is taking his wife and kids out to eat. He wants to see where a specific food truck is, so he takes out his phone, ready to get on the food truck locator website.</p>

        <br>precondition:  Michael has Safari opened up on his iPhone.<br>

    <br> post-condition: Michael is able to locate a specific truck.<br>

    <br>
        <li>M: types in food truck locator in search bar. </li>
        <li>W: displays home page with two buttons that say 'Search' and 'Browse'</li>
        <li>M: clicks on the Search button</li>
        <li>W: loads up to a page with a text box to enter food truck name and a Submit button. </li>
        <li>M: types in name and clicks on Submit button.</li>
        <li>W: page loads with information other people have posted as well as the truck owners.</li>
