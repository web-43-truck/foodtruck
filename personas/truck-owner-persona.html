    <h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> John needs to update his food truck's location on his socials. John is tired of changing locations on different social media platforms, but has just learned of a new website that offers the option to create a business profile and, easily, update the location of his food truck. John wants to create a new profile on the food truck locator website and post his location.</p>
    <p><strong>Pre-condition:</strong> John has Google's search engine open on his MacBook Air.</p>
    <p><strong>Post-condition:</strong> John successfully creates a food truck user profile and posts his location.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>John searches the food truck locator website on Google and click's on the website's name.</li>
        <li>The locator website opens up to the home page and displays a sign-up button.</li>
        <li>John clicks on the sign-up button.</li>
        <li>The website displays the sign-up form that asks for details about the profile creator and food truck business.</li>
        <li>John enters his information and the information about the food truck, and he clicks submit.</li>
        <li>The website displays the food truck user profile and, because it is a new account, prompts the user to enter details about the food truck's location, hours, and pictures.</li>
        <li>John enters the food truck's current location, the hours, a few pictures, and hits submit on a button.</li>
        <li>The website notifies the user that the profile is up-to date and returns to the food truck user profile home page where the new location is now displayed.</li>
