        <strong>Name</strong> Michael Scott<br>

        <br><strong>Tech</strong> Average tech user.  He owns an Asus Zenbook laptop and an iPhone 15.   <br>

        <br><strong>Proficiency</strong> Michael loves new iPhones but that's about as far as his technology knowledge goes.

        <br><strong>Attitudes / Behaviors</strong> Michael  is a student going to class in downtown Albuquerque.  He loves food trucks but with his schedule, he's never able to catch them.  <br>

        <br><strong>Frustrations / Needs</strong> Michael is frustrated that he doesn't know when or where a food truck will appear. He just hopes that he'll get lucky and come across one.  He also gets frustrated with facebook groups for food trucks because they aren't consistent and sometimes he doesn't know exactly how to navigate through them. <br>

        <br><strong>Attitudes and Needs</strong> Michael loves food and simple websites.  Michael hates when a complicated website gets in the way of him being able to eat something good on his lunch break.  <br>


        <br><strong>User Story</strong> As a miscellaneous  user, I need to easily find and navigate through a website that shows me where other people see food trucks that way I can go to them whenever I want.
