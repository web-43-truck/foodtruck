# Ground Rules
## Communication / Meetings 
Whiteboard meetups during open work (once a week)
* Every Monday we will meet to talk about emotional awareness and understand where each of us are at starting the week in order to give additional support where needed. 
* 1 hour of our lunch to meet up (huddle on slack) 
* Using slack to communicate summaries on where we are at with out work (daily). 
* Emotional Support / Conflict Resolution 
* Keeping a can-do attitude and an open mind 
* Talking one at a time, letting each other finish their thoughts
* Communicate want needs vs. wants
* !!! How to handle that situation !!!: Walk away and reconvene and talk when you feel more calm and able to communicate, reaching out to others (classmates, family, friends) codeword: timeout 
* Ask don’t assume, communicate don’t suppress. 
* Triggers
